# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. It includes a Flask-based web application where users can input these features and receive real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Imputes missing values and encodes categorical variables.
- **Logistic Regression Model:** Uses Logistic Regression to analyze features and predict survival outcomes.
- **Flask Web Application:** Provides an interactive interface for users to input data and get predictions.

## Files
- `model.py`: Script to train and save the Logistic Regression model.
- `app.py`: Flask application for user interaction and prediction.
- `templates/index.html`: HTML template for the web application interface.
